# Sinewave-generator
This C program generates a sinewave and writes its data to a text file.
It is a rather simple program and works very well as a way to introduce someone to the world of signal processesing.
You can import the raw data into an audio editing application and process the signal. 
Changing the amplitude and frequency will change the data written to the text file which allows you to generate a different sound.
